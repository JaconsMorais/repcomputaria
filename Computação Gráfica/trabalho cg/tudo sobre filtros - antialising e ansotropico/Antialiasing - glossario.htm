      Antialiasing, as the name suggests, is a technique used to combat an 
      effect known as aliasing.<BR><BR>When a line is drawn on a piece of paper, 
      its edges appear smooth regardless of the line's orientation. When a line 
      is drawn on a computer display, whether CRT- or LCD-based, the limited 
      resolution of the display means that, if it isn't precisely horizontal or 
      vertical, the line will appear as if it is constructed in a series of 
      "steps". This is aliasing and the stepped effect is often known as "the 
      jaggies". The various methods used to overcome the jaggies, and produce 
      lines which appear to the viewer to be smooth, are referred to as 
      antialiasing.<BR><BR>
      <DIV class=c1><IMG height=263 alt=Antialiasing 
      src="Antialiasing%20-%20glossario_arquivos/antialiasing.gif" width=400 
      border=0> </DIV><BR>The simplest of these techniques is illustrated in the 
      accompanying diagram, in which actual size and enlarged versions of lines 
      drawn on a computer display at an angle of 66°, with and without 
      antialiasing, are shown. The line on the left, without antialiasing, shows 
      the stepped effect of the jaggies. To make the line truly smooth-edged, 
      portions of the white pixels in direct contact with the black pixels would 
      also need to be black but, since only whole pixels can be addressed by 
      displays, another method must be found. Fortunately, the human visual 
      system is fairly easy to fool and the image on the right shows how 
      antialiasing can do this. By using shades which fall between black and 
      white in pixels which form the edge of the line, the stark contrast 
      between the two extreme shades, which humans use to identify edges, is 
      smoothed out and the optical illusion that the jaggedness of the line has 
      been reduced is achieved. Note that the text in the diagram has also been 
      produced with and without antialiasing being applied and how it affects 
      the appearance of the letters.<BR><BR>One of the advantages that CRT 
      displays have over LCD displays is that, because the individual pixels are 
      created by glowing areas of phosphor, they have no definite edges. 
      Consequently, light from adjacent pixels tends to overlap partially, 
      causing slight blurring: a built-in antialiasing effect.<BR><BR>Aliasing 
      can also occur when dealing with digital audio, when it produces the audio 
      equivalent of the jaggies, which is a buzzing sound.<BR><BR>
