      A simple form of texture filtering, <A 
      href="http://www.meko.co.uk/pointsamp.shtml">point sampling</A>, could be 
      used to scale textures prior to their being mapped onto surfaces in a 3D 
      scene. This technique could easily introduce errors by taking a too simple 
      approach to the task.<BR><BR>Using a more sophisticated, though slower, 
      technique called "bi-linear filtering", the colour of each pixel on the 
      target surface is calculated by averaging the colours of four adjacent 
      texels from the source texture. Using the example texture given in <A 
      href="http://www.meko.co.uk/pointsamp.shtml">point sampling</A>, which 
      consists of alternating black and white texels, the colour of the 
      resulting pixel plotted to the target surface would be a grey halfway 
      between black and white. This is obviously a much closer approximation to 
      the way the texture should look after scaling than the result yielded by 
      point sampling but it can also produce a blurred effect when the texture 
      is applied to a surface close to the viewer. This can be seen in the 
      accompanying screenshots from the game Turok. In the first screenshot, no 
      filtering has been applied and the textures appear "blocky"; in the other, 
      bi-linear filtering has been applied and the "blockiness" disappears to be 
      replaced by a blurred, but more pleasing, effect.<BR><BR>

      use of a <A href="http://www.meko.co.uk/mipmap.shtml">mip-map</A> , a more 
      accurate result, though still blurred and even more costly in terms of 
      processing power, can be obtained by using "tri-linear filtering". This 
      makes use of two copies of the texture, stored at different scales in the 
      mip-map, by applying bi-linear filtering to the textures with scales above 
      and below the currently required scale. The average of these two results 
      is then taken and applied to the target surface.<BR><BR>Bilinear and 
      tri-linear texture filtering are certainly a big improvement on point 
      sampling but are only really useful on surfaces that are at right-angles 
      to the viewer. This is because they both rely on the square as their 
      sampling area. <A 
      href="http://www.meko.co.uk/anisofilter.shtml">Anisotropic filtering</A> 
      is a technique more suited to texturing angled surfaces.<BR><BR>
