      Anisotropic means "non-uniform shape" and it is because this filtering 
      technique works on non-uniform, or uneven, shaped areas that it is more 
      powerful, and takes much more processing power, than <A 
      href="http://www.meko.co.uk/pointsamp.shtml">point sampling</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.meko.co.uk/bitrilinear.shtml">bi-linear or tri-linear 
      filtering</A>.<BR><BR>One of the problems with these methods is that they 
      rely on a square as their sampling area and are, therefore, only effective 
      on surfaces at right angles to the viewer. The sampling area used by these 
      methods is, in fact, circular but, as they all base their calculations on 
      a 2 x 2 pixel area within that circle, the area they work on is 
      effectively square. When a surface is at an angle to the viewer, an area 
      on the surface that appears to the viewer to be circular is, in fact, 
      elliptical in shape if the viewpoint is moved so that the surface is seen 
      square on. Anisotropic texture filtering calculates the shape of this 
      ellipse, maps it onto the required texture and then takes an average of 
      the colours from up to 32 texels within the ellipse to decide what colour 
      should be plotted onto the target surface. Since the ellipse can have any 
      ratio between its height and width, depending on the angle it is tilted at 
      with respect to the viewer, the arrangement of the texels to be sampled 
      can only be calculated at runtime and will rarely consist of rows or 
      columns of an equal number of texels. It is from this variable arrangement 
      that the label "anisotropic" comes.<BR><BR>Because anisotropic texture 
      filtering requires so many calculations to be done to plot a single pixel, 
      it has, until quite recently, been available only on the most expensive 3D 
      hardware. Now, though, a new generation of graphics processors are 
      becoming available which have sufficient power to allow the inclusion of 
      anisotropic filtering in their features. Amongst the current crop of 
      processors with this feature are: ATI's Rage 128 Pro, Matrox' G400, 
      Nvidia's Riva TNT, S3's Savage 4, Trident's Blade 3D and Videologic's 
      PowerVR.<BR><BR>
